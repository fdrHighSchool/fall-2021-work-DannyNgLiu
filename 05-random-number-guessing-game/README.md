# Random Number Guessing Game

## Major take-aways

* I got to use the scanner method which gets the next line using nextLine.

* I got to import java packages using java.util.*

* java.util.* imports all of the java packages.

* I also learn how to use the for loop to help traverse, compare and contrast a list of numbers

* I learned that `length.()` gave the length of the list which was very helpful in determining if the user input is
  the same as keywords I listed in an array.

*I learned that strings cannot be compared like integers using == so we had to use `.equals()`
