# Processing DMV Example

## Pair programming

##3 Major take-aways

* I learned how to use a lot of new methods in Processing like `.rect()`, `.circle()`, `.arc()`, etc.

* I learned to use -= to change the x-axis values to move objects/shapes to the left. If these shapes pass a x-value (usually
  of the screen), the x-value is set to a number which is top the right of the screen and will slowly move back to the left.
  Sort of like a conveyer belt.

* I also used -= += to decrease/increase the color value to change the time to dark or blue sky.
