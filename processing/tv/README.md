# Processing TV

## Processing individual programming

### Major take-aways

* I first experimented with colors using `fill()` and found out there were websites where you can upload pictures and get the exact color

* I used if statements to see if shapes were close to the border of the display and if that is true, these shapes would change
directions and bounce back

* `blackground(0)` was used to to set the background of the display to black.
